		Everyone can see there's a change in me
They all say I'm not the same kid I used to be
Don't go out and play
I just dream all day
They don't know what's wrong with me
And I'm too shy to say
It's my first love
What I'm dreaming of when I go to bed
When I lay my head upon my pillow
Don't know what to do
My first love thinks that I'm too young
She doesn't even know
Wish that I could show her what I'm feeling
'Cause I'm feeling my first love
Mirror on the wall (mirror on the wall)
Does she care at all?
Will she ever notice me
Could she ever fall?
Tell me, teddy bear
Why love is so unfair
Will he ever find a way
And answer to my prayers?
For my first love

For my first love
What I'm dreaming of when I go to bed
When I lay my head upon my pillow
Don't know what to do
My first love thinks that I'm too young
She doesn't even know
Wish that I could show her what I'm feeling

Wish that I could show her what I'm feeling
'Cause I'm feeling my first love
'Cause I'm feeling my first loveEveryone can see there's a change in me
They all say I'm not the same kid I used to be
Don't go out and play
I just dream all day
They don't know what's wrong with me
And I'm too shy to say
It's my first love
What I'm dreaming of when I go to bed
When I lay my head upon my pillow
Don't know what to do
My first love thinks that I'm too young
She doesn't even know
Wish that I could show her what I'm feeling
'Cause I'm feeling my first love
Mirror on the wall (mirror on the wall)
Does she care at all?
Will she ever notice me
Could she ever fall?
Tell me, teddy bear
Why love is so unfair
Will he ever find a way
And answer to my prayers?

When I lay my head upon my pillow
Don't know what to do
My first love thinks that I'm too young
She doesn't even know
Wish that I could show her what I'm feeling
'Cause I'm feeling my first love
Mirror on the wall (mirror on the wall)
Does she care at all?
Will she ever notice me
Could she ever fall?
Tell me, teddy bear
Why love is so unfair
Will he ever find a way
And answer to my prayers?
For my first love
What I'm dreaming of when I go to bed
When I lay my head upon my pillow
Don't know what to do
My first love thinks that I'm too young
She doesn't even know
Wish that I could show her what I'm feeling
'Cause I'm feeling my first love
What I'm dreaming of when I go to bed
When I lay my head upon my pillow
Don't know what to do
My first love thinks that I'm too young
She doesn't even know
Wish that I could show her what I'm feeling
'Cause I'm feeling my first love
'Cause I'm feeling my first love
